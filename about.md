# Hi! My name is Sander Moolin.

I'm a web and game developer at [Fuzzco](https://fuzzco.com/) focused on Vue, SVG, WebGL, and accessibility.

I've worked on:

-   [Fuzznuxt](https://github.com/fuzzco/fuzznuxt), a Prismic/Nuxt static site boilerplate
-   [vue-three-wrap](https://github.com/SaFrMo/vue-three-wrap), a wrapper component to simplify creating [three.js](https://threejs.org/) scenes
-   [Several sites for Fuzzco and Funkhaus](https://gist.github.com/SaFrMo/29a6fbd90047233ec9bf124acba2044b), including:
    -   [Pretend Foundry Font Builder](https://pretendfoundry.com/font-builder): Make-your-own font game that converts canvas drawings to .ttf downloads
    -   [Imagine Entertainment](https://imagine-entertainment.com/): New site from the ground up for the high-profile film studio
    -   [Elizabeth Taylor](https://elizabethtaylor.com/biography): Interactive timeline of the star's life
    -   [Synack](https://www.synack.com/): Three.js scene with custom shaders and an SVG-based game
    -   [Primer](https://www.primer.com/): Custom canvas/SVG fluid graphics throughout site and a 3D tile viewer
    

Some of my

I'm [non-binary](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-non-binary-people-how-to-be-respectful-and-supportive), so I use they/them pronouns. I also believe very strongly in the [Ethical Design pyramid](https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design/).

White [AMAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_assignment#Terminology) programmers like myself have a responsibility to understand how the tools they build can be used to harm people who US society already actively works to harm, especially people of color and/or people who are trans, queer, feminine, and/or have disabilities.

Tech needs people who will be affected directly by the tools they build, not just who will make money off of those tools.

I want to contribute to a world where those points are the bare minimum for building software and creating art with code, and I want to do so in a way that creates exciting, beautiful, and challenging material.
