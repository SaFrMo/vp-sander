# Hi! My name is Sander Moolin.

I'm a web developer focused on Vue, WordPress, SVG, and accessibility.

I've worked on:

*   [Vuepress](https://github.com/funkhaus/vuepress), a template to build Vue site for WordPress
*   [Several sites for Funkhaus](https://gist.github.com/SaFrMo/29a6fbd90047233ec9bf124acba2044b), a web design firm based in LA
*   [Several NPM packages](https://gist.github.com/SaFrMo/d13f47de90ff0a8bc1d4ee3621a1a7b6), with a focus on zero-dependency libraries

I'm also very interested in game development and decentralized apps/browsing. I've contributed to:

*   [Fritter](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/fritter), a decentralized Twitter clone
*   [A reusable library](https://github.com/SaFrMo/phaser-component-library) of [Phaser](https://phaser.io) components
*   [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/users/safrmo/), a regular worldwide game jam

I use they/them pronouns and believe very strongly in the [Ethical Design pyramid](https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design/).

US programmers like myself have a responsibility to understand how the tools they build can be used to harm people who US society already actively works to harm, especially people of color and/or people who are trans, queer, feminine, and/or have disabilities.

Tech needs people who will be affected directly by the tools they build, not just who will make money off of those tools.

I want to contribute to a world where those points are the bare minimum for building tools and creating art with code, and I want to do so in a way that creates exciting, beautiful, and challenging material.

I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sandermoolin), [Github](https://github.com/safrmo), and [Fritter](dat://14e02bfbe6d66113327a1e2f473dcd639dc3d9d97a05c1e5778a6c295fd02095). Thanks for reading!
